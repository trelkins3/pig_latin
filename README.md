C++ Pig Latin Translator

In my junior year of high school the final project was to create a program that could take in phrases and output them as pig latin. The assignment ended up being extra credit, and despite spending several extra class periods of time trying to finish it I was unable to wrap my brain around it and complete the project.

Fast forward 8 years, 1 college degree, and almost 2 years in industry later and I have conceived of a solution. strtok is the tool of the devil. 16 year old me: read it and weep in awe at my brilliance (and/or basic comprehension of C++).
