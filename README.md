# pig_latin
A little command line translator for pig latin.

Ostensibly public proof that I can code in C++

*In my junior year of high school I took an introductory level programming class. The final project was to create a program that could take in phrases and output them as pig latin. The assignment ended up being extra credit, and despite spending several extra class periods of time trying to finish it I was unable to wrap my brain around it and complete the project. strtok, strings, and character comparisons and manipulation appeared to have gotten the better of me.*

*Fast forward 8 years, 1 college degree, and 2 years in industry later and I have conceived of a solution. Read it and weep.*

*strtok is the tool of the devil.*
